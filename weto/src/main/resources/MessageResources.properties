after the "/"). Each pattern can be a regular expression accepted by \
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" target="_blank">\
the Java Pattern class</a>. Note that this means e.g. that a dot "." is a wildcard that \
matches any character. Use the escaped version "\\." to match a dot character as such.<br />\
&nbsp;Example 1: <strong>solution\\.pdf / solution\\.txt</strong> accepts "solution.pdf" \
and "solution.txt".<br />\
&nbsp;Example 2: <strong>.*\\.txt</strong> allows all files with suffix ".txt".<br />\
&nbsp;Example 3: <strong>.*</strong> allows all files.<br />\
&nbsp;Example 4: <strong>my solution.txt / mysolution.txt</strong> accepts "my solution.txt" and "mysolution.txt".<br />
submissionProperties.instructions.keptFileLimit=If you specify a limit to the number \
of old submissions to keep, a user who has reached the old submission limit can not\
create a new submission without first deleting at least one old submission.
submissionProperties.instructions.patternDescriptions=Since regular expressions may \
be difficult to understand for users, you may also specify a more "user-friendly" \
alternative description of the accepted file name patterns that will be shown to the user. \
The actual matching will still be based on the actual pattern(s) given above.<br />\
&nbsp;Example: If the patterns are <strong>.*\.txt / .*\.pdf</strong>, one might wish \
to show the simpler description <strong>*.txt *.pdf</strong> to the users.
submissionProperties.instructions.zipping=You may also allow submitting the accepted \
file(s) within a zip-file. In this case the system will also allow any zip-file to be \
uploaded: the zip-file will be unpacked and files that match with an accepted pattern \
will be included into the submission. <strong>Do not select this option if the actual \
submission itself can be a zip-file!</strong>
